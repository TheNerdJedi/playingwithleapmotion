# Playing With LeapMotion

I was able to borrow my friend's LeapMotion for a while, so I played around with it. In the end I was able to implement various 
types of gestures, and was able to track one's hand, by the LeapMotion Controller giving me various types of values.

I'll give more info later on how to implement this onto your Leap Motion and how to combine this with Unity, so your game can be
more interactive.
